###### Installing the plugin for testing.
###### This job is a joke.

```bash
pip install .\dist\myplugin-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl

# use pip3.10 if you have multiple Python versions installed
```

###### Okay, so now we should be good to run the plugin.

```bash
myplugin
```

###### Looks like I need to pass it some arguments.
###### That's fine, but I'm late for a meeting.
###### Seriously, grooming EVERY sprint?
###### Are all these Agile ceremonies REALLY necessary?

If your terminal shows the below output, good! The `myplugin` plugin is installed successfully, then. Move on to Entry 4.

```bash
usage: myplugin.exe -p [-h]
myplugin.exe: error: the following arguments are required: -p
```
