###### Okay, let's install Pip packages.

```bash
pip install build

# use pip3.10 if you have multiple Python versions installed
```

###### That didn't take too long.
###### Now to try that build again.

```bash
python -m build

# use python3.10 if you have multiple Python versions installed
```

###### Cool, version 0.0.1 built successfully.
###### I thought this was supposed to be hard?...

If your terminal showed a bunch of output, and the last line is green text that looks like the text below, well done! Move to Entry 3.

```bash
Successfully built myplugin-0.0.1.tar.gz and myplugin-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

On the other hand, you may have run into an issue where the `pip install` command did not run correctly. This is most likely to occur if you have multiple Python installations. Regardless, ask a Mentor for assistance!
