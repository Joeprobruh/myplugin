# Cloning a GitHub Repository in Visual Studio Code

## Overview
This guide will walk you through the process of cloning a GitHub repository using the terminal within Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and configured on your machine.
- You need to have access to the repository you want to clone.

## Steps

### Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code
1. **Launch VS Code**:
   - Locate the Visual Studio Code icon on your desktop or in your applications folder.
   - Double-click the icon to open the application.

### Step 2: Open a Terminal Window
1. **Open the Terminal**:
   - Click on the **Terminal** menu in the top menu bar.
   - Select **New Terminal** from the dropdown. You can also use the shortcut:
     - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + ` (backtick)
     - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + ` (backtick)

### Step 3: Navigate to the Desired Directory
1. **Change Directory (Optional)**:
   - If you want to clone the repository into a specific folder, navigate to that folder using the `cd` command.
   - For example:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/directory
     ```

### Step 4: Clone the Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/gohere.git
     ```
   - This command will create a local copy of the repository in a new folder named `gohere`.

### Step 5: Open the Cloned Repository
1. **Open the Cloned Folder**:
   - After cloning, you can open the folder in VS Code.
   - Click on the **File** menu in the top menu bar.
   - Select **Open Folder...** from the dropdown.
   - Navigate to the newly created `gohere` folder and click **Select Folder**.

## Conclusion
You have successfully cloned the repository from GitHub using the terminal within Visual Studio Code. You can now start working on the project!
